			            </p>
			            <br>

			            <p>Users may not send mass unsolicited e-mail, which is email that is sent to recipients who have not "opted-in" to mailings from the user. Users who send mass mailings must maintain complete and accurate records of all consents and opt-ins and provide such records to Riven Cloud upon its request. If a user cannot provide positive and verifiable proof of such consents and opt-ins, we will consider the mass mailing to be unsolicited. Users are prohibited from operating mailing lists, listservs, or mailing services that do not target an audience that has voluntarily signed up for e-mail information using an "opt-in" process or that has made their e-mail addresses available to a user for distribution of information. Users who operate mailing lists must maintain complete and accurate records of all consents and "opt-in" elections and provide such records to Riven Cloud upon its request. If a user cannot provide positive and verifiable proof of such consents and "opt-in" elections, we will consider the list mailing to be unsolicited. Any user-maintained mailing list must also allow any party on the list to remove itself automatically and permanently. Other prohibited activities include, without limitation, the following:

			                <li> spamming via third-party proxy, aggregation of proxy lists, or installation of proxy mailing software;</li>
			                <li> configuration of a mail server to accept and process third-party messages for sending without user identification and authentication;</li>
			                <li> hosting web pages advertised within "spam e-mail" sent from another network (spamvertising);</li>
			                <li> hosting web pages or providing services that support spam;</li>
			                <li> any other unsolicited bulk messages, postings, or transmissions through media such as weblog posts, IRC/chat room messages, guestbook entries, HTTP referrer log entries, usenet posts, pop-up messages, instant messages, or SMS messages; and instructing others in any activity prohibited by this AUP.</li>

			            </p>
			            <br>


			            <h2>Reporting Abuse</h2><br>
			            <p>Any party seeking to report any violations of Riven Cloud's policy may contact via e-mail: <a href="mailto:legal@riven.io">legal@riven.io</a>
			            </p>
			            <br>

			            <h2>Setup Time</h2><br>
			            <p>We typically aim to deploy servers within 2-10 business days, however for various reasons we may need up to 60 calendar days to deploy your server. We will deploy your server as soon as possible. No refund will be provided for servers that are cancelled while waiting for deployment.
			            </p>
			            <br>


			            <h2>Support</h2><br>
			            <p>System software support is only provided for "fully managed" server customers. Absolutely no software support is provided for "unmanaged" server customers, unmanaged clients can certainly submit support requests relating to replacing failed hardware. All servers come with integrated IPMI/KVM allowing you complete remote control over the system. Our unmanaged products are intended for expert system administrators, or those who have their own system administrators already employed. Unmanaged customers facing KVM or hardware outages will be dealt with on a "best effort" basis during business hours, however immediate response and assistance can be received with the use of a high priority ticket (which will incur a fee of $65). Managed customers hardware is monitored 24/7 and high priority tickets for managed clients are free of charge for dealing with any hardware or website outages.
			            </p>
			            <br>


			            <h2>Account Ownership</h2><br>
			            <p>Accounts opened with a company name are for official use by the mentioned company only, and you confirm that you are authorized to make purchases for and on behalf of the company, and that the company has authorized use of and will pay for Riven Cloud's services. Accounts may not be loaned, transferred, or sold to third parties. To transfer a server or service to a third party you must contact Riven Cloud to arrange the transfer of the service into a new account.
			            </p>
			            <br>


			            <h2>Billing Period</h2><br>
			            <p>Billing period change requests will be considered on a case by case basis, at Riven Cloud's sole discretion. We reserve the right to refuse any billing period change request without reason. If you sign up on our monthly rate and then at a later date wish to submit a change request for a quarterly or other prepaid billing period you must give us at least 10 days notice via the support portal before your next due date. Failure to provide notice will result in your current billing period staying in effect for one more period, and the change, if accepted by management, will take effect on the next period after that.
			            </p>
			            <br>


			            <h2>Cancellations</h2><br>
			            <p>You may cancel your server by providing us with at least 10 days cancellation notice via a ticket in the support portal ( <a href="https://portal.sa.net/">https://portal.sa.net/</a> ). If you fail to provide notice 10 days before the end of your billing period you agree to be billed for 1 more period.
			            </p>
			            <br>


			            <h2>Special Offer &amp; Discount Pricing</h2><br>
			            <p>Special offer pricing may be limited to 1 per customer, or new customers only, decided on a per case basis. Special offer/discounted servers may not be used to replace existing services. Cancelling of any server will result in promotion pricing being removed from all servers ordered on special offer/discount, regular pricing for all servers will be applied.
			            </p>
